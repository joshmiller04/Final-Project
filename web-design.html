        <h2>Web Design Services</h2>
        <p>Throughout my time in MI 349, I have learned foundational skills in HTML and CSS, which have given me a comprehensive understanding of web development basics. Through hands-on projects, I practiced creating structured, accessible HTML5 pages and styling them with responsive, visually appealing CSS. Now, I am eager to bring these skills into a professional environment, where I can build functional and user-centered websites that meet diverse client needs. MI 349 has prepared me to apply these concepts effectively, and I am excited to continue expanding my expertise. From personal portfolios to business websites, I can design user-friendly, SEO-optimized websites to help clients establish their online presence.</p>
